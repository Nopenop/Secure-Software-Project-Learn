## Developer Tools

These are the set of tools that I believe will be critical to efficiently completing this project that each team member should have some experience with.

### Text Editor (visual studio code)



### Git
Version Control - how does one create and modified code in a group.

This tutorial will give you a basic understanding of what git does, why it is used and some of the command line functionality:

[Introduction to git][git_intro_link]

This is git's reference documentation (helpful for deeper understanding of how it is used):

[Git documentation][git_documentation]

## Cloud Native Information

The following sections will give you an introduction to the tools we will use to implement our cloud based system. 

I suggest that you go through this in order as they are listed (linux, docker, kubernetes). You will come to see that kubernetes built off of containerization (docker) and containerization is built off of the linux shell.

### Tools you should install to interact with some of the lessons

This page will send you to the docker desktop's start page. Docker desktop is a gui for accessing you containers. You will have a better understanding of what that will means towards the end of this section.

[Docker Desktop][docker_desktop]

After installing and running docker desktop, you should be able to open you terminal/command line to run the following command

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu sh
```

If you do not know how docker works right now, that is ok. This is will create a locally running ubuntu filesystem on your machine for you to learn linux. 

### Linux
This is a link to an interaction tutorial for linux. For our purposes, you can stick to the grasshopper lessons :)

You should be able to follow the steps within that running instance of ubuntu above.

### Docker

This is an introductory video to docker and containerization:

This is some of docker's own tutorials if you would like to get more practice
