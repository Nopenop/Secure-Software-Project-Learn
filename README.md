# Secure-Software-Project-Learn
This repository is a list/ guide of the tools and technologies that we will most likely use for our project. 

I created this repository so each of our members has a base line knowledge and enables a basis of terminology and skills for productive communication towards the production of our project

If you ever have any questions, please hit me up on discord and I would be down to help you out on call, text, or in person.

### Thank you for looking through this guide. You are actively taking the steps you will need to better understand the technologies used for this project and building the skills that are in demand of developers/programmers

## Developer Tools

These are the set of tools that I believe will be critical for efficiently completing this project that each team member should have some experience with.

### Text Editor (visual studio code)
visual studio code is a graphical text editor that is extremely user friendly. If this is your for ide/text editor, this is a great choice to learn the tools to make you a better developer.

Furthermore, vscode has a variety of easy to install extensions that will help with beginning our project journey

Here is a beginner's tutorial for vscode that will get you acquainted with the editor:

### Git
Version Control - how does one create and modified code in a group.

Git is a version control system that can be used to take several peoples code and automate combining the changes added.

This tutorial will give you a basic understanding of what git does, why it is used and some of the command line functionality:

[Introduction to git][git_intro_link]

This is git's reference documentation (helpful for deeper understanding of how it is used):

## Cloud Native Information

The following sections will give you an introduction to the tools we will use to implement our cloud based system. 

I suggest that you go through this in order as they are listed (linux, docker, kubernetes). You will come to see that kubernetes built off of containerization (docker) and containerization is built off of the linux shell.

### Tools you should install to interact with some of the lessons

This page will send you to the docker desktop's start page. Docker desktop is a gui for accessing you containers. You will have a better understanding of what that will means towards the end of this section.

[Docker Desktop][docker_desktop]

After installing and running docker desktop, you should be able to open you terminal/command line to run the following command

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu sh
```

If you do not know how docker works right now, that is ok. This is will create a locally running ubuntu filesystem on your machine for you to learn linux. 

### Linux
This is a link to an interaction tutorial for linux. For our purposes, you can stick to the grasshopper lessons :)

You should be able to follow the steps within that running instance of ubuntu above.

### Docker

This is an introductory video to docker and containerization:
